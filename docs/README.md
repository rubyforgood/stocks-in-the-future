# Stocks for Good developer documentation

Welcome to the internal documentation for _Stocks for Good_.

This section of the repository is dedicated to **technical documentation**
intended for developers, contributors, and future maintainers. It covers system
architecture, development practices, and design decisions that influence how the
app is built and evolves.

## Purpose

While the main `README.md` in the root of the repository is designed to help users
and new developers get started quickly, this `/docs` directory provides deeper
insight into:

- **How** the system works under the hood
- **Why** certain frameworks, gems, and patterns were chosen
- **What** trade-offs were considered during development

This documentation serves as both a knowledge base and a decision log.

## Writing Guidelines

- Write in plain Markdown (`.md`) so it remains portable and readable on GitHub
and in any editor.
- Prefer **clarity over completeness** â€” focus on what someone else (or future-you)
would need to understand.
- Include dates and authors on major decisions when helpful.

    <ul class="sif-works sif-works-content">
      <li>All SIF teachers receive training in September before the program begins. SIF classes begin in October.</li>
      <li>Teachers work with a scripted curriculum outlining how to teach investment fundamentals and basic financial literacy skills.</li>
      <li>There is flexibility to be creative when using the SIF curriculum.</li>
      <li>The SIF Curriculum is “interdisciplinary.” Mathematics, reading and social studies skills are reinforced throughout the program.</li>
      <li>Teaching tools include a teacher edition, student workbooks, “Growing Money” for 6th graders, and PowerPoints all found on Google Docs.</li>
      <li>Teachers are given links to access these resources during teacher training.</li>
      <li>Weekly attendance and quarterly grades are entered on the SIF website quarterly by SIF instructors.</li>
      <li>SIF coordinates having guest speakers visit SIF classes throughout the school year.</li>
      <li>Some SIF classes may be eligible for class trips throughout the school year.</li>
      <li>Our SIF Program Specialist visits each class on average of 3 times a school year to collect data.</li>
      <li>We have an Instagram page developed for SIF teachers and students that outlines what’s new with SIF investments.</li>
